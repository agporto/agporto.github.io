excerpt: 'Morphometrics has become an indispensable component of the statistical analysis of size and shape variation in biological structures. Morphometric data has traditionally been gathered through low-throughput manual landmark annotation, which represents a significant bottleneck for morphometric-based phenomics. Here we propose a machine-learning-based high-throughput pipeline to collect high-dimensional morphometric data in images of semi rigid biological structures.'
