title: "Evolution of the Genotype-to-Phenotype Map and the Cost of Pleiotropy in Mammals"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2016-01-01-evolution-genotype
excerpt: 'Evolutionary studies have long emphasized that the genetic architecture of traits holds important microevolutionary consequences. Yet, studies comparing the genetic architecture of traits across species are rare, and discussions of the evolution of genetic systems are made on theoretical arguments rather than on empirical evidence. Here, we compared the genetic architecture of cranial traits in two different mammalian model organisms: the gray short-tailed opossum, Monodelphis domestica, and the laboratory mouse, Mus musculus.
