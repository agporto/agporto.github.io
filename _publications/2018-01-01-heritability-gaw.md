title: "Heritability and genetic associations of triglyceride and HDL-C levels using pedigree-based and empirical kinships"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2018-01-01-heritability-gaw
excerpt: 'The heritability of a phenotype is an estimation of the percent of variance in that phenotype that is attributable to additive genetic factors. Heritability is optimally estimated in family-based sample populations. Traditionally, this involves use of a pedigree-based kinship coefficient generated from the collected genealogical relationships between family members. An alternative, when dense genotype data are available, is to directly measure the empirical kinship between samples. This study compares the use of pedigree and empirical kinships in the GAW20 data set.'
