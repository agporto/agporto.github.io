title: "Reliability of genomic predictions of complex human phenotypes."
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2018-01-01-reliability-genomic
excerpt: 'Genome-wide association studies have helped us identify a wealth of genetic variants associated with complex human phenotypes. Because most variants explain a small portion of the total phenotypic variation, however, marker-based studies remain limited in their ability to predict such phenotypes. Here, we show how modern statistical genetic techniques borrowed from animal breeding can be employed to increase the accuracy of genomic prediction of complex phenotypes and the power of genetic mapping studies.'
